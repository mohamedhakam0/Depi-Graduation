\section*{Egypt Real Estate Market Analysis}

This project analyzes the Egyptian real estate market using data from Kaggle, aiming to identify trends and patterns in property prices, locations, and features. The insights gained can help individuals make informed real estate decisions.

\subsection*{Data Cleaning and Preparation}

The raw dataset underwent cleaning and transformation using Microsoft Excel and Power Query:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Region Mapping:} A new "Region" column was added, and each city was manually assigned a region.
\item \textbf{Data Accuracy:} The "Fill Down" method filled blank cells, and inconsistencies were corrected.
\item \textbf{Data Type Conversion:} Data types were adjusted for accuracy.
\item \textbf{Column Renaming and Index Addition:} Columns were renamed, and an index column was added.
\item \textbf{Data Filtering:} Rows with unreliable data were removed.
\item \textbf{Delivery Date Estimation:} Missing delivery dates were estimated based on the "Delivery Term".
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Data Analysis and Visualizations}

Analysis was performed using Microsoft Power BI to create a dynamic dashboard. 

\subsubsection*{Key Insights}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Price Influencers:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Property types: Standalone villas have the highest average price [1].
        \item Location: East Cairo is the most expensive region [2].
        \item Features: Furnished and finished properties command higher prices [3, 4].
    \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Demand Trends:}
